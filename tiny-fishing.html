                    <h2>About This Cozy Game</h2>
                    <p>Escape the hustle and bustle with Tiny Fishing, the ultimate casual online fishing game designed for pure relaxation. On Cozyverse, we believe in the therapeutic power of simple, repetitive tasks, and Tiny Fishing delivers this in spades. There are no complicated controls or stressful timers, just you, your fishing rod, and a sea of cute, pixelated fish waiting to be discovered. The gameplay loop is incredibly addictive yet calming: cast your line, guide your hook to catch as many fish as possible, and reel them in for cash.</p>
                    <p>What makes Tiny Fishing a truly great cozy game is the gentle sense of progression. Use your earnings to upgrade your equipment. Increase the number of fish you can catch at once, extend the depth of your line to discover new and rarer species, or earn more cash passively while you're away. Each upgrade feels rewarding and pushes you to explore just a little bit deeper on your next cast. Whether you have five minutes or an hour to spare, this free fishing game offers an endless, tranquil escape. Dive in and see what treasures you can find in the deep blue sea!</p>

                        <li><strong>Depth is Key:</strong> Prioritize upgrading your line depth early on. Deeper waters hold more valuable and rare fish.</li>
