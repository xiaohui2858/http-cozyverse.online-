                    <h2>About This Cozy Game</h2>
                    <p>Welcome to the serene world of Water Sort Puzzle, a game that has quickly become a global favorite for those seeking a moment of peace and mental clarity. Here on Cozyverse, we present this delightful challenge as a cornerstone of our relaxing online game collection. It's more than just a game; it's a form of meditation. The gentle sound of water pouring and the satisfying sight of colors separating create a truly zen-like experience, perfect for unwinding after a long day or for a quiet break.</p>
                    <p>The premise is beautifully simple, yet the game offers layers of engaging complexity. You are presented with several test tubes, each containing a mix of different colored liquids. Your goal is to sort these liquids so that each tube contains only a single color. This task requires foresight, planning, and a touch of strategy, making it an excellent free brain-teaser. As you progress, the levels introduce more tubes and colors, offering a steady, rewarding difficulty curve that keeps you engaged without ever feeling overwhelming. If you're looking to play a free puzzle game that is both stimulating and soothing, you've found the perfect match.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Sort the colored water in the tubes until all colors are in separate tubes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Controls:</strong> Simply click (or tap on mobile) on a tube to select it, then click on another tube to pour the top layer of liquid into it.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rule:</strong> You can only pour water into another tube if it is empty or if the top layer of water is the same color.</li>

                    <h2>Tips & Tricks for Success</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Utilize Empty Tubes:</strong> An empty tube is your most powerful tool. Use it as a temporary holding space to shuffle liquids around.</li>
                        <li><strong>Plan Ahead:</strong> Before making a move, try to visualize the next 2-3 steps. Avoid trapping colors you'll need later.</li>
                        <li><strong>Don't Be Afraid to Restart:</strong> If you feel stuck, the 'Restart' button is your friend. It’s a no-pressure cozy game, after all!</li>
