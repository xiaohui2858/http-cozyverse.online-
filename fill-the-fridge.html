                    <h2>Tips & Tricks for Success</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Big Items First:</strong> Always try to place the largest items, like milk cartons or soda packs, before smaller ones.</li>
                        <li><strong>Think in Blocks:</strong> Group similar items together. Try to create solid, rectangular blocks of items to maximize space.</li>
                        <li><strong>Use the Doors:</strong> Don't forget the door compartments! They are perfect for smaller, thinner items like sauce bottles.</li>
